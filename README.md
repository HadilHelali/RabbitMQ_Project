# RabbitMQ_Project
This is a simple example of a java Project using RabbitMQ 
In partie3 package , I implemented a simple application that contains 2 tasks to edit 2 different sections of a text document, and one more
task (third) to read and display the text. The 3 tasks are distributed in different computers and the communication will be held with RabbitMQ
